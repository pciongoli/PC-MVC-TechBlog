Model View Controller (MVC): PC MVC Tech Blog

## Link to Deployed Project

-  https://github.com/pciongoli/PC-MVC-TechBlog

For this project I have created a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, in which developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.
This site is deployed via Heroku (please see deployment above). This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Technologies

-  JavaScript
-  Sequelize
-  Handlebars
-  CSS
